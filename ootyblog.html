                    <p>It was the December of year 2021 we planned a trip to Ooty. We landed to Bangalore at night. We were so hungry we grabbed biryani from one of the food vendors at airport. We hired a taxi to the bus stop. We took the pre booked bus to the ooty. It dropped us to the ooty station in morning, from there we hired an auto that dropped us to our hotel. Unfortunately, our booking was cancelled and we had to find another hotel. I booked another hotel at the roadside which was very close to the ooty markets. That’s what a girl wants- Food and shopping :D But it was unintentional though. We visited the local market that afternoon, visited few chocolate shops which ooty is famous for. They had hell lot of varieties chocolates and fudges for soooo reasonable prices as if you’re buying vegetables or may be cheaper than that. I bought so many different chocolates and fudges for two of us- me and my husband. Then we headed back to our hotel since we were little late to visit the famous ooty boat house. Next day we planned for ooty boat house, we reached there early morning. We had our breakfast at canteen near to boat house. Then we booked a paddle boat and paddled it for 1 hour. May be it was my husband who actually did it but since he is my better half so if he did then I also did. After that we went to thriller zone where we played for few hours. 
                        Next day we planned for rose garden and botanical garden. We went to botanical garden in morning. We walked till botanical garden from our hotel. There is an entry ticket at the gate. This lush green garden was spread over 55 acres. We enjoyed it fully then we came out and bought some exotic fruits from the vendors at the botanical garden. We went to Rose garden in evening, it was situated at Elk Hill in Vijayanagaram of Ooty. It was the most beautiful rose garden I have ever seen in my life, so nice, no unique and so arranged. They had so many varieties of roses there. Then we headed back to our hotel. We ate at near by hotel they served delicious food there. Next day we planned for Pykara trip. We hired a taxi from ooty to Pykara. He dropped us to Pykara waterfall early morning, The view was beautiful so clean and organized. Then we headed to Pykara lake, we visited the lake then he dropped us to the Nilgiri Mountain mini train station. We had some time and empty stomachs, we went to a near by canteen to enjoy south Indian thali, the sambar was delicious. We took the mini rail to Coimbatore station. We had pre booked the train. We somehow fitted our luggage, my husband packs so many clothes for me. The overall experience was surreal. The train took us to so many scenic places and also it was raining sometimes we had to shut down the windows but I kept looking outside. Then we stopped at one station for a short break, the station was filled with monkeys, People were giving them food and they were trying to enter the train, we had to shut the door closed so the monkeys won’t enter the train. It was fun. We reached to Coimbatore station then we booked a taxi to the airport. That’s how we say bye-bye to ooty.
